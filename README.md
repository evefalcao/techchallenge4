# Tech Challenge 4 ðŸ“±

This is a React Native application built with [Expo](https://expo.dev) and [Expo Router](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction/) for navigation. The project was created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app) and features a tab-based navigation structure.

## Project Structure

The app uses Expo Router's file-based routing with a tab navigation layout:

```
app/
â”œâ”€â”€ _layout.tsx          # Root layout with Stack navigation
â””â”€â”€ (tabs)/             # Tab group
    â”œâ”€â”€ _layout.tsx     # Tab navigation layout
    â”œâ”€â”€ index.tsx       # Home screen (posts display)
    â””â”€â”€ admin.tsx       # Admin screen
```

## Features

- **Tab Navigation**: Two main tabs - Home and Admin
- **Home Screen**: Designed to display posts (currently shows placeholder text)
- **Admin Screen**: Administrative interface
- **TypeScript Support**: Full TypeScript configuration
- **ESLint**: Code linting with Expo-specific rules

## Get Started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the development server

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in:

- [Development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

## Available Scripts

- `npm start` - Start the Expo development server
- `npm run android` - Start the app on Android
- `npm run ios` - Start the app on iOS
- `npm run web` - Start the app on web
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint to check code quality

## Development

The main application logic is located in the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction/) with Expo Router.

## Technology Stack
